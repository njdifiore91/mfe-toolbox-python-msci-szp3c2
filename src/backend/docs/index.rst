MFE Toolbox Documentation
=========================

Introduction
------------

The MFE (MATLAB Financial Econometrics) Toolbox is a comprehensive suite of Python modules designed for modeling financial time series and conducting advanced econometric analyses. The toolbox has been completely re-implemented using Python 3.12, incorporating modern programming constructs such as async/await patterns and strict type hints. It leverages Python's scientific computing ecosystem, built upon foundational libraries including NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Statsmodels.

Features
--------

Key features of the MFE Toolbox include:

- Financial time series modeling and forecasting
- Volatility and risk modeling
- High-frequency financial data analysis
- Cross-sectional econometric analysis
- Bootstrap-based statistical inference
- Advanced distribution modeling and simulation
